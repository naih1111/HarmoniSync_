## üìä Key Metrics Explained

### What These Numbers Mean

#### **SNR (Signal-to-Noise Ratio)**
**What it is**: Measures how much louder your voice is compared to background noise.
- **Formula**: `SNR = 20 √ó log10(Signal Power / Noise Power)`
- **Units**: Decibels (dB)

**Range Guide**:
- **Excellent**: -10 dB to 0 dB (voice much louder than noise)
- **Good**: -15 dB to -10 dB (clear voice detection)
- **Acceptable**: -25 dB to -15 dB (usable but some interference)
- **Poor**: Below -25 dB (too much noise, unreliable)

**Current System**: -22.0 dB (Acceptable - works but could be cleaner)

#### **VAD Confidence (Voice Activity Detection)**
**What it is**: How sure the system is that you're actually singing/speaking (not silence or noise).
- **Range**: 0% to 100%
- **Purpose**: Prevents false note detection during quiet moments

**Range Guide**:
- **Excellent**: 85-100% (very confident voice detection)
- **Good**: 70-84% (reliable voice detection)
- **Acceptable**: 50-69% (some uncertainty but usable)
- **Poor**: Below 50% (unreliable, lots of false triggers)

**Current System**: 70-79.9% (Good - reliable detection)

#### **Outliers**
**What it is**: Number of "weird" pitch readings that don't match the pattern.
- **Example**: If you're singing a steady note, outliers are the random wrong frequencies
- **Impact**: Too many outliers = jumpy, unstable note display

**Range Guide**:
- **Excellent**: 0-5 outliers (rock solid stability)
- **Good**: 6-20 outliers (stable with minor fluctuations)
- **Acceptable**: 21-50 outliers (noticeable but usable)
- **Poor**: 51-100 outliers (very jumpy display)
- **Critical**: 100+ outliers (unusable, constant jumping)

**Current System**: 72 outliers (Poor - still too jumpy, needs improvement)

#### **Health Score**
**What it is**: Overall system performance combining all metrics.
- **Calculation**: Weighted average of SNR, VAD confidence, outlier count, and stability
- **Range**: 0% to 100%

**Range Guide**:
- **Excellent**: 85-100% (professional-grade performance)
- **Good**: 75-84% (reliable for training use)
- **Acceptable**: 60-74% (usable but not optimal)
- **Poor**: Below 60% (needs significant improvement)

**Current System**: 65% (Acceptable - works but has room for improvement)

### **Why These Matter for Solf√®ge Training**
- **Low SNR**: Background noise interferes with pitch detection
- **Low VAD Confidence**: System might detect notes when you're not singing
- **High Outliers**: Note display jumps around, making it hard to see your actual pitch
- **Low Health Score**: Overall unreliable experience, frustrating for practice
